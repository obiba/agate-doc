Web Introduction
================

The Agate Web Application is the administration web interface of the Agate server. It is NOT the end-user web portal and therefore firewall policies can (or should) be applied to restrict access to administrators or content editors.

See the :ref:`domain` presentation page for a detailed description of the type of documents that can be edited through this web interface.

The following manuals are available:

* :doc:`users`: add, edit users
* :doc:`groups`: add, edit groups
* :doc:`applications`: add, edit applications
* :doc:`tickets`: track user sessions
* :doc:`administration`: configure server settings

Requirements
------------

This web interface is a javascript application requiring a modern web browser. There is no requirement regarding the operating system.
