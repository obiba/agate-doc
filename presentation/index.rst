====================

Targeted at individual studies and study consortia, OBiBa software stack (Opal, Mica2 etc.) provides a software solution for epidemiological data management, analysis and publication. While Opal--the core data warehouse application--provides all the necessary tools to import, transform and describe data, Mica provides everything needed to build personalized web data portals and publish content of research activities of both studies and consortia. Based on the content defined in Mica, Drupal is the prefered platform to build your personalized web portal.

Agate is the OBiBa's central authentication server which intends to be easy to install and to use. Agate centralizes also some user related services such as profile management, and a notification system using emails.
