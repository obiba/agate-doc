Configuration
=============

Servers
-------

The file **AGATE_HOME/conf/application.yml** is to be edited to match your server needs. This file is written in YAML format allowing to specify a hierarchy within the configuration keys. The YAML format uses indentations to express the different levels of this hierarchy. The file is already pre-filled with default values (to be modified to match your configuration), just be aware that you should not modify the indentations. In the following documentation, the configuration keys will be presented using the dot-notation (levels are separated by dots) for readability.

HTTP Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agate server is a web application and as such, you need to specify on which ports the web server should listen to incoming requests.

=============== ==================
Property        Description
=============== ==================
``server.port`` HTTP port number. Generally speaking this port should not be exposed to the web. Use the https port instead.
``server.host`` Web server host name.
``https.port``  HTTPS port number.
=============== ==================

MongoDB Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agate server will store its data (system configuration, networks, studies, datasets, etc.) in a MongoDB database. You must specify how to connect to this database.

======================== ========================
Property                 Description
======================== ========================
``mongodb.url``          MongoDB host and port names using the format: host:port
``mongodb.databaseName`` Name of the Agate server database in MongoDB. If it does not exist it will be automatically created.
``mongodb.username``     User name for connection to MongoDB database.
``mongodb.password``     User password for connection to MongoDB database.
``mongodb.authSource``   The name of the authentication database.
``mongodb.options``      Read Connection Options to learn more. Do not include the uri. in the URL.
======================== ========================

By default MongoDB does not require any user name, it is highly recommended to configure the database with a user. This can be done by enabling the Client Access Control procedure:

* create a user with the proper roles on the target databases
* restart the MongoDB service with Client Access Control enabled

Once the MongoDB service runs with Client Access Control enabled, all database connections require authentication.

**MongoDB 3.x Settings**

The default authentication mechanism has changed since MongoDB 3.0 and the driver used by Agate does not support (yet) this new mechanism. According to the documentation about the authentication mechanisms:

.. epigraph::

  MongoDB uses the SCRAM-SHA-1 as the default challenge and response authentication mechanism. Previous versions used MONGODB-CR as the default.

Then before creating the user, restore ``MONGODB-CR`` as the default mechanism with the following script:

.. code-block:: javascript

  use admin
  var schema = db.system.version.findOne({"_id" : "authSchema"})
  schema.currentVersion = 3
  db.system.version.save(schema)

**MongoDB User Creation Example**

The example below creates the agateadmin user for agate database:

.. code-block:: javascript

  use admin
  db.createUser(
    {
      user: "agateadmin",
      pwd: "agateadmin",
      roles: [
        {
          "role" : "readWrite",
          "db" : "agate"
        },
        {
          "role" : "dbAdmin",
          "db" : "agate"
        },
        {
            "role": "clusterMonitor",
            "db": "admin"
        },
        {
            "role": "readAnyDatabase",
            "db": "admin"
        }
      ]
    }
  )

Here is the required configuration snippet in **/etc/agate/application.yml** for the above user:

.. code-block:: yaml

  spring:
    data:
      mongodb:
        uri: mongodb://agateadmin:agateadmin@localhost:27017/agate?authSource=admin

.. note::

  Agate requires either **clusterMonitor** or **readAnyDatabase** role on the admin database for validation operations. The first role is useful for a cluster setup and the latter if your MongoDB is on a single server.

User Directories
----------------

The security framework that is used by Agate for authentication, authorization etc. is `Shiro <http://shiro.apache.org/>`_. Configuring Shiro for Agate is done via the file **AGATE_HOME/conf/shiro.ini**. See also `Shiro ini file documentation <http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SHIRO/Configuration#Configuration-INISections>`_.

.. note::

  Default configuration is a static user 'administrator' with password 'password' (or the one provided while installing Agate Debian/RPM package).

By default Agate server has several built-in user directories (in the world of Shiro, a user directory is called a realm):

* a file-based user directory (**shiro.ini** file),
* the internal user directory persisted in the MongoDB database.

Although it is possible to register some additional user directories, this practice is currently not recommended. It is also not recommended to use this file-based user directory for adding users. It is mainly dedicated to define a default system super-user. For a better security, user passwords are encrypted with a one way hash such as sha256. The example **shiro.ini** file below demonstrates how encryption is configured.

.. code-block:: bash

  # =======================
  # Shiro INI configuration
  # =======================

  [main]
  # Objects and their properties are defined here,
  # Such as the securityManager, Realms and anything else needed to build the SecurityManager


  [users]
  # The 'users' section is for simple deployments
  # when you only need a small number of statically-defined set of User accounts.
  #
  # Password here must be encrypted!
  # Use shiro-hasher tools to encrypt your passwords:
  #   DEBIAN:
  #     cd /usr/share/agate/tools && ./shiro-hasher -p
  #   UNIX:
  #     cd <AGATE_DIST_HOME>/tools && ./shiro-hasher -p
  #   WINDOWS:
  #     cd <AGATE_DIST_HOME>/tools && shiro-hasher.bat -p
  #
  # Format is:
  # username=password[,role]*
  administrator = $shiro1$SHA-256$500000$dxucP0IgyO99rdL0Ltj1Qg==$qssS60kTC7TqE61/JFrX/OEk0jsZbYXjiGhR7/t+XNY=,agate-administrator

  [roles]
  # The 'roles' section is for simple deployments
  # when you only need a small number of statically-defined roles.
  # Format is:
  # role=permission[,permission]*
  agate-administrator = *

Passwords must be encrypted using shiro-hasher tools (included in Agate tools directory):

.. code-block:: bash

  cd /usr/share/agate/tools
  ./shiro-hasher -p

Notification Emails
-------------------

Agate offers a notification emails service to the registered applications. Based on email templates, an application can request Agate to send emails to one or more of its users. These templates are defined in the **AGATE_HOME/conf/templates** directory. Agate is using email templates for sending its notifications (email confirmation, reset password etc.).

The email templates specific to an application are located in the directory **AGATE_HOME/conf/templates/<application name>**.

The template engine used for building the email messages is `thymeleaf <http://www.thymeleaf.org/>`_.

Reverse Proxy Configuration
---------------------------

Agate server can be accessed through a reverse proxy server.

**Apache**

Example of Apache directives that:

* redirects HTTP connection on port 80 to HTTPS connection on port 443,
* specifies acceptable protocols and cipher suites,
* refines organization's specific certificate and private key.

.. code-block:: text

      ProxyPreserveHost On
      <Proxy *>

      ReWriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} !^443$
      RewriteRule ^/(.*) https://agate.your-organization.org:443/$1 [NC,R,L]

      # Prevent CRIME/BREACH compression attacks
